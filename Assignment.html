	<p> Here's a quote telling a fun fact about dogs from a Reader's Digest article. </p>
	<blockquote cite = "https://www.rd.com/list/dog-facts-you-didnt-know/" >
	Dogs can smell thousands of times better than humans. 
	Their noses have millions more scent receptors—for example, 
	a human nose averages five million, while a Dachshund’s nose has 125 million—making dogs useful for sniffing out drugs, dead bodies, bed bugs, explosives, and other things dogs can smell that humans can’t.
